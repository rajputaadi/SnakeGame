# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics module. The game allows the player to control a snake, eat food, and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Real-time Gameplay:** The snake moves continuously, and the player can control its direction using arrow keys.
- **Food Consumption:** The snake grows longer when it eats food, and the score increases.
- **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, resetting the game when a collision occurs.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks the score and the high score.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have Python installed. No additional packages are required beyond the standard Python library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files (`snake_class.py`, `food.py`, `score.py`, and the main script) to your local machine.

2. Ensure that all files are in the same directory for the imports to work correctly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Game:**

   Execute the main script using Python:

   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
